getting started with typer

Someday, maybe, this will be a repo with code showing the basics of typer.

The typer documentation is good but the examples are spread around the various topics.
I want a single code base with examples all in one place.
That's what I'm eventually going to put here.
And I'll probably split commands and sub-commands into modules or sub-packages.
That will be my opinionated perspective on how to structure code for typer projects with lots of features.
